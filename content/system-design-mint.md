## Step 1: Outline use cases and constraints

> Gather requirements and scope the problem.
> Ask questions to clarify use cases and constraints.
> Discuss assumptions.

Without an interviewer to address clarifying questions, we'll define some use cases and constraints.

### Use cases

#### We'll scope the problem to handle only the following use cases

* **User** connects to a financial account
* **Service** extracts transactions from the account
    * Updates daily
    * Categorizes transactions
        * Allows manual category override by the user
        * No automatic re-categorization
    * Analyzes monthly spending, by category
* **Service** recommends a budget
    * Allows users to manually set a budget
    * Sends notifications when approaching or exceeding budget
* **Service** has high availability

#### Out of scope

* **Service** performs additional logging and analytics
